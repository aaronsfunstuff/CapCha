# CAPTCHA Game

This project is a simple CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game requires the user to click on specific car images to verify.

## Features

- **Image Selection**: Click on the car images displayed in the game area to select them.
- **Verification**: Click the "Check Answer" button to verify if you've selected the correct images.
- **Reset**: Easily reset the game by clicking on any image again to deselect it.

## How It Works

The game is built using basic web technologies:

- **HTML**: Defines the structure of the game interface and includes the game area and button.
- **CSS**: Styles the game area, images, and button for a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. Pastel colors and subtle animations enhance the game's aesthetic.
- **JavaScript**: Provides the interactivity by handling image selection, verification logic, and game reset functionality. Images are positioned randomly within the game area to prevent overlap using JavaScript calculations.
